                    <p>Skimata, derived from the fusion of 'scheme' and 'mata' (the Filipino word for 'eye'), embodies a powerful visualization
                    tool designed to illuminate the intricate world of memory and CPU allocation schemes. With an intuitive interface,
                    Skimata provides users with a dynamic platform to explore and comprehend various allocation strategies, such as fixed
                    partitions, page replacement policies, priority scheduling, and Shortest Remaining Time. Witness the allocation
                    processes unfold before your eyes, gaining valuable insights into system efficiency and resource management. Skimata
                    empowers users to grasp the complexities of these schemes effortlessly, enhancing understanding and facilitating
                    informed decision-making in the realm of computer system optimization.</p>

                    <p>In the context of fixed partitions, which allow for multiprogramming, the main memory's user processes area is divided
                    into static partitions at system startup. Each job is allocated one contiguous partition using a first-come,
                    first-served allocation method. Three methods for free space allocation—first-fit, best-fit, and worst-fit—determine how
                    memory is assigned to new jobs.</p>

                    <p>In the realm of page replacement policies, the selection of the page to be removed plays a pivotal role in system
                    efficiency. The choice of the page replacement algorithm is crucial, and two widely recognized policies are first-in,
                    first-out (FIFO) and least recently used (LRU). The FIFO policy operates on the principle that the optimal page for
                    removal is the one that has been in memory the longest. These page replacement strategies are fundamental to managing
                    memory resources effectively in a computer system..</p>

                    <p>Priority scheduling involves assigning a priority number (integer) to each process, with the CPU allocated to the
                    process having the highest priority (where a smaller integer indicates a higher priority). However, a notable challenge in priority scheduling is the NP-Scheduling Problem, where low-priority processes may face
                    starvation, meaning they might never get the opportunity to execute.</p>

                <div class="text">
                    <p>Remaining Time is a preemptive version of Shortest Job Next (SJN) scheduling, where the CPU is allocated to the process
                    closest to completion. In this strategy, a process holding the CPU may be preempted or interrupted if a newer process in
                    the READY queue has a shorter time to completion. Notably, when processes arrive simultaneously, the system resorts to
                    Shortest Job Next (SJN) to determine the most efficient allocation.</p>
